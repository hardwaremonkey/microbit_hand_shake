# micro:bit hand_shake

This project enables people with physical disability to communicate through gesture using BBC micro:bits. One micro:bit is worn on the wrist and a second is connected to a laptop or communications device. When a gesture is made, the motion is detected by the micro:bit on the wrist. This micro: bit uses its radio to signal the micro:bit connected to the laptop. The micro:bit attached to the laptop then sends a trigger signal through the USB cable connected to the laptop. This signal can be used to control software on the laptop. The trigger can also be used as to control communications software, such as Smartbox's Grid software.
